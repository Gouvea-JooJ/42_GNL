| Objectives
- Implement Line Reading Functionality: The main objective is to create a function, get_next_line, that reads a line from a file descriptor each time it is called. This function must be robust enough to handle various scenarios, such as different buffer sizes and incomplete lines.
- Enhance Memory Handling Skills: The project aims to improve students' understanding of memory management in C, particularly with dynamic memory allocation, buffer handling, and memory leak prevention.
- Develop Reusable Code: The function developed in this project is intended to be reusable in future projects, so students must write clean, modular, and efficient code that can be easily integrated into larger programs.
- Prepare for Advanced File Handling: The project lays the groundwork for more complex file handling tasks in future projects, ensuring students are comfortable with reading and processing files in C.

| Challenges

- File Handling: One of the key challenges is mastering file handling in C, particularly managing reading operations from files and standard input efficiently.
- Memory Management: The project requires dynamic memory allocation and proper handling of buffers. Managing memory leaks and ensuring that memory is properly freed is crucial.
- Buffer Management: Students must implement a buffer system that can handle various input sizes, which is challenging, especially when dealing with different edge cases like reading very large files or incomplete lines.
- Handling Multiple File Descriptors: Another challenge is correctly handling multiple file descriptors simultaneously, ensuring that each is read and managed independently.

| Learnings
- Advanced Memory Management: Students learn to manage memory dynamically, dealing with buffer allocation and reallocation, and ensuring no memory is leaked during the function's execution.
- Handling Edge Cases: The project teaches students to anticipate and handle various edge cases, such as end-of-file scenarios, reading from empty files, and managing different buffer sizes.
- Code Modularity and Reusability: Writing a function that can be easily reused in other projects helps students understand the importance of modular code design and encourages best practices in code organization.
- Problem-Solving Under Constraints: The project challenges students to solve problems within the constraints of the C language and the project specifications, honing their ability to find creative and efficient solutions.
